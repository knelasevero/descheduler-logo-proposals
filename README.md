# descheduler-logo-proposals

Using this repo to generate logos for the Descheduler project to give it a "face" :D

First one was created using stable difusion (https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-announcement) and a bit of textual inversion and some other shenanigans.

You can generate a similar one if you use seed 3258159489 on https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream with propmt "robot killing robot logo".

Our altered version is this one: https://github.com/knelasevero/descheduler-logo-proposals/blob/main/proposals/descheduler_logo1.png
