# descheduler-logo-proposals

Using this repo to generate logos for the Descheduler project to give it a "face" :D

First one was created using stable difusion (https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-announcement) and a bit of textual inversion and some other shenanigans.

You can generate a similar one if you use seed 3258159489 on https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream with propmt "robot killing robot logo".

Our altered version is this one: https://github.com/knelasevero/descheduler-logo-proposals/blob/main/proposals/descheduler_logo1.png (Credits of this one goes to all the model contributors, including artists and coders, Lucas (@knelasevero) and Iuri(iurisevero))

We may generate a few more if we are not happy with this one, or ask the community artists to provide help, if they can. :)
